            Web developer (Full-Stack) <br>
            I studied software engineering through self-learning from online academies such as ALzeroWebSchool Academy by engineer Osama Al Zero, and I benefited from several other sources such as the MDN web docs website and w3schools, as well as through research and experiments.
            This educational journey enabled me to build and program websites based on designing and programming interfaces (FrontEnd) and creating backends with databases BackEnd and linking them to (API).
            <br><br>
            I worked on several technical projects, most notably the website of the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan in Riyadh. Nearly 7,000 visitor benefited from this site who applied for the issuance of a passport. The embassy was able to organize the numbers of its visitors, send review dates, and complete their procedures in an orderly manner. According to its daily capacity.
            <br><br>
            I also worked in administrative positions for approximately 6 years
            I was honored to work under the management of His Eminence Sheikh Dr. Abdul Mohsen Al-Qasim, Imam and Preacher of the Prophet’s Mosque, at the Holy Quran Academy in the Prophet’s Mosque as an administrative employee in the Examinations Division.
